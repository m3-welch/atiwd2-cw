## Task 3: Charts Visualisation (20 marks)
### Use [Google Chart](https://developers.google.com/chart/) or any other charts API to visualise the following charts:

A scatter chart to show a years worth of data (averaged by month) from a specific station for Carbon Monoxide (NO) at a certain time of day - say 08.00 hours.

A line chart showing levels in any 24 hour period on any day (user selectable) for any of the six stations (user selectable) for any of the major pollutants (nox, no, no2) in the date range downloaded.

All charts should give an accurate rendition of the data set at an appropriate resolution.

Note that you can restrict the data to the range 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2019
